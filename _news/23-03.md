**\-** Our **NSF RI CORE** proposal [End-to-end Learning of Fair and Explainable Schedules for Court Systems](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2232054). has been funded! We'll develop differentiable optimization tools for equitable & explainable scheduling and work on changing the pretrial scheduling process to reduce nonappearance and promote fairness in the American Court system! Thank you, **NSF**!

I am co-editing a new book :open_book: on **Differential Privacy** . It covers topics from foundations, to applications in optimization (including in Census data release, image and video, and medicine), machine learning (including privacy attacks, federated learning, and private algorithms) as well as policy and ethics aspects. Stay tuned!
