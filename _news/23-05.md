Our **NSF-ENG EPCN** proposal [Physics Informed Real-time Optimal Power Flow](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2242931) has been funded!
We'll integrate machine learning and physics to optimize power flow, integrate systems dynamics, and increase grid reliability. We'll work on scalable and robust ML for energy solutions. Thank you, **NSF**!
