	<h1> PhD Positions in Integration of Constrained Optimization and Deep Learning</h1>

	<div id="content">

	One funded PhD positions are available in the area of “Integration of Constrained Optimization
	and Deep Learning.” The PhD candidate will work under the supervision of Prof. Ferdinando Fioretto
	at the EECS Department, Syracuse University. The position start date is January 2022.
	<br>
	The PhD candidate is committed to conduct independent and original research, to report on
	this research in international publications and conference presentations, and to describe the
	results of the research in a PhD dissertation.


	<h3>Candidate Qualification</h3>
	You will be working in a phase-phase and dynamic team on intellectually
	stimulating problems at the intersection of theoretical and practical questions.
	The ideal PhD candidate will have a strong mathematical background,
	must have a master degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Industrial
	Engineering, or related areas.
	Knowledge of the following areas is a distinctive plus:
	<ul>
		<li>Optimization Theory: Linear Programming, Convex Programming</li>
		<li>Constraint Programming</li>
		<li>Deep Learning models: Feedforward, Sequence models, Graph Neural Networks</li>
		<li>Deep Reinforcement Learning</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Topic Description</h3>
	The
	The recent attempts at leveraging machine learning to solve constrained optimization problems. It focuses on surveying the work on integrating combinatorial solvers and optimization methods with machine learning architectures. These approaches hold the promise to develop new hybrid machine learning and optimization methods to predict fast, approximate, solutions to combinatorial problems and to enable structural logical inference. This paper presents a conceptual review of the recent advancements in this emerging area

	The recent surge in optimization and machine learning research, in particular,
	deep learning, paved the way for a number of applications, many of which use privacy-sensitive user data. The resulting models have been shown to often reveal private user information, which may harm individual users. <br>
	To contrast these risks, a new line of research aims at developing variants of optimization and ML algorithms that preserve the privacy of the individuals contained in the used datasets. Additionally, there is an increasing interest in leveraging distributed data shared across organizations to augment AI-powered services. Examples include transportation services, sharing location-based data to improve on-demand capabilities, and hospitals, sharing data to prevent epidemic outbreaks.
	The proliferation of these applications leads to a transition from proprietary data acquisition and processing to data ecosystems where different agents learn and make decisions using data owned by different organizations, boosting the need for privacy-preserving technologies.
	<br>
	The project focuses broadly on protecting the privacy of individuals without losing the benefits of large scale data analysis. Topics of interest include:
	<ul>
		<li>Privacy-preserving technology, such as Differential Privacy and secure multi-party computation</li>
		<li>Distributed Machine Learning</li>
		<li>Privacy-preserving Multiagent Systems</li>
		<li>Privacy-Preserving Adversarial Deep Generative Models</li>
	</ul>
	The project will combine fundamental aspects of privacy, optimization and distributed computation to design algorithms that perform (distributed) machine learning and decision making while guaranteeing they do not violate privacy. <br>
	The ideal candidate will have a strong background and interest in machine learning, privacy-preserving technologies, and/or multi-agent systems. Publications in leading international venues (such as AAAI, IJCAI, AAMAS, ICML, NeurIPS) will be an advantage.

	<h3>To Apply</h3>
	Applications should be submitted at <a href="mailto:ffiorett@syr.edu">ffiorett@syr.edu</a> and candidates should include their resume and transcript (if available).
