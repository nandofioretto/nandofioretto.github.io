					A variety of computationally challenging  optimization problems in several engineering disciplines are solved repeatedly under different scenarios. In many cases, they would benefit from fast and accurate approximations, either to support real-time operations or large-scale simulation studies. 
				 These optimization problems arise in numerous contexts including in energy systems, mobility, resilience, and disaster management. These applications must capture physical laws such as Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s law in electrical power systems, the Weymouth equation in gas networks, flow constraints in transportation models, and the Navier-Stoke’s equations for shallow water in flood mitigation. Moreover, they often feature constraints that represent good engineering and operational practice to protect various devices.
				 <br>
				 This main direction of my research on Deep Learning for Optimization aims at exploring how to leverage deep learning models to 
				 aid the resolution of constrained optimization problems and, in particular, optimization problems with hard physical and engineering constraints.

					<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong>:
					The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) is a key building block in many power system applications. It determines generator setpoints at minimal cost that meet the power demands while satisfying the underlying physical and operational constraints. It is non-convex and NP-hard, and computationally challenging for large-scale power systems. Motivated by the increased stochasticity in generation schedules and increasing penetration of renewable sources, this paper explores a deep learning approach to deliver highly efficient and accurate approximations to the AC-OPF. In particular, the paper proposes an integration of deep neural networks and Lagrangian duality to capture the physical and operational constraints. The resulting model, called OPF-DNN, is evaluated on real case studies from the French transmission system, with up to 3,400 buses and 4,500 lines. Computational results show that OPF-DNN produces highly accurate AC-OPF approximations whose costs are within 0.01% of optimality. OPF-DNN generates, in milliseconds, solutions that capture the problem constraints with high fidelity.

				<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong>:
				This paper explores the potential of Lagrangian duality for learning applications that feature complex constraints. Such constraints arise in many science and engineering domains, where the task amounts to learning optimization problems which must be solved repeatedly and include hard physical and operational constraints. The paper also considers applications where the learning task must enforce constraints on the predictor itself, either because they are natural properties of the function to learn or because it is desirable from a societal standpoint to impose them.
				This paper demonstrates experimentally that Lagrangian duality brings significant benefits for these applications. In energy domains, the combination of Lagrangian duality and deep learning can be used to obtain state of the art results to predict optimal power flows, in energy systems, and optimal compressor settings, in gas networks. In transprecision computing, Lagrangian duality can complement deep learning to impose monotonicity constraints on the predictor without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, Lagrangian duality can be used to enforce fairness constraints on a predictor and obtain state-of-the-art results when minimizing disparate treatments.

					A variety of computationally challenging constrained optimization problems in several engineering disciplines are solved repeatedly under different scenarios. In many cases, they would benefit from fast and accurate approximations, either to support real-time operations or large-scale simulation studies. This paper aims at exploring how to leverage the substantial data being accumulated by repeatedly solving instances of these applications over time. It introduces a deep learning model that exploits Lagrangian duality to encourage the satisfaction of hard constraints. The proposed method is evaluated on a collection of realistic energy networks, by enforcing non-discriminatory decisions on a variety of datasets, and a transprecision computing application. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method that dramatically decreases constraint violations by the predictors and, in some applications, increases the prediction accuracy.				</div>

					<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong>:
					The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem is a fundamental building block for the optimization of electrical power systems. It is nonlinear and nonconvex and computes the generator setpoints for power and voltage, given a set of load demands. It is often needed to be solved repeatedly under various conditions, either in real-time or in large-scale studies. This need is further exacerbated by the increasing stochasticity of power systems due to renewable energy sources in front and behind the meter. To address these challenges, this paper presents a deep learning approach to the OPF. The learning model exploits the information available in the prior states of the system (which is commonly available in practical applications), as well as a dual Lagrangian method to satisfy the physical and engineering constraints present in the OPF. The proposed model is evaluated on a large collection of realistic power systems. The experimental results show that its predictions are highly accurate with average errors as low as 0.2%. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to improve the accuracy of widely adopted OPF linear DC approximation by at least two orders of magnitude.
