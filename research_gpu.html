				A variety of central problems in AI, including finding the most probable explanation (MPE) in Bayesian networks and constraint optimization problems, are modeled as optimizing the costs of a network of cost functions.
				These graphical models are used to support decision making under uncertainty as well as to  explain a domain, and are used in medical diagnosis, semantic search, and biological network learning. Despite their importance, the inherent complexity of these models challenges their scalability and usability in large complex problems.
				<br>
				Recently, massively parallel architectures, such as those found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">Graphical Processing Units</a> (GPUs), have witnessed an enormous success in a wide range of AI applications, including accelerated deep learning, image processing, and data analysis. A GPU offers thousands of computing cores and can provide an unprecedented application performance by offloading compute-intensive portions of the application into it.

				Part of my research investigates how to devise efficient and scalable algorithms to solve large optimization problems over graphical models by exploiting the availability of GPUs.

					<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong>:
					Discrete optimization is a central problem in artificial intelligence. The optimization of the aggregated cost of a network of cost functions arises in a variety of problems including Weighted Constraint Programs (WCSPs), Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP), as well as optimization in stochastic variants such as the tasks of finding the most probable explanation (MPE) in belief networks. Inference-based algorithms are powerful techniques for solving discrete optimization problems, which can be used independently or in combination with other techniques. However, their applicability is often limited by their compute intensive nature and their space requirements. This paper proposes the design and implementation of a novel inference-based technique, which exploits modern massively parallel architectures, such as those found in Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), to speed up the resolution of exact and approximated inference-based algorithms for discrete optimization. The paper studies the proposed algorithm in both centralized and distributed optimization contexts. The paper demonstrates that the use of GPUs provides significant advantages in terms of runtime and scalability, achieving up to two orders of magnitude in speedups and showing a considerable reduction in execution time (up to 345 times faster) with respect to a sequential version.

					<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong>:
					With the growing complexity of the current power grid, there is an increasing need for intelligent operations coordinating
					energy supply and demand. A key feature of the smart grid vision is that intelligent mechanisms will coordinate the production,
					transmission, and consumption of energy in a distributed and reliable way.
					<em>Economic Dispatch</em> (ED) and <em>Demand Response</em> (DR) are two key problems that need to be solved to achieve this
					vision. In traditional operations, ED and DR are implemented separately, despite the strong inter-dependencies between these
					two problems. Therefore, we propose an integrated approach to solve the ED and DR problems that simultaneously maximizes the
					benefits of customers and minimizes the generation costs, and introduce an effective multi-agent-based algorithm, based on
					<em>Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems</em> (DCOPs), acting on direct control of both generators and dispatchable
					loads. To cope with the high complexity of the problem, our solution employs <em>General Purpose Graphical Processing Units</em>
					(GPGPUs) to speed up the computational runtime. We empirically evaluate the proposed algorithms on standard IEEE bus systems
					and test the stability of the proposed solution with a state-of-the-art power system simulator on the IEEE 30-bus system.

					<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong>:
					<em>Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems</em> (DCOPs) have been used to model a number of multi-agent
					coordination problems. In DCOPs, agents are assumed to have complete information about the utility of their
					possible actions. However, in many real-world applications, such utilities are stochastic due to the presence
					of exogenous events that are beyond the direct control of the agents. This paper addresses this issue by
					extending the standard DCOP model to <em>Expected Regret DCOP</em> (ER-DCOP) for DCOP applications with
					uncertainty in constraint utilities. Different from other approaches, ER-DCOPs aim at minimizing the overall
					expected regret of the problem. The paper proposes the ER-DPOP algorithm for solving ER-DCOPs, which is
					complete and requires a linear number of messages with respect to the number of agents in the problem. We
					further present two implementations of ER-DPOP---GPU- and ASP-based implementations---that orthogonally
					exploit the problem structure and present their evaluations on random networks and power network problems.

					<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong>:
					The field of <em>Distributed Constraint Optimization</em> (DCOP) has gained momentum in recent years, thanks to its ability to
					address various applications related to multi-agent coordination. Nevertheless, solving DCOPs is computationally challenging.
					Thus, in large scale, complex applications, incomplete DCOP algorithms are necessary. Recently, researchers have introduced a
					promising class of incomplete DCOP algorithms, based on sampling. However, this paradigm requires a multitude of samples to
					ensure convergence. This paper exploits the property that sampling is amenable to parallelization, and introduces a general
					framework, called <em>Distributed MCMC</em> (DMCMC), that is based on a dynamic programming procedure and uses
					<em>Markov Chain Monte Carlo</em> (MCMC) sampling algorithms to solve DCOPs. Additionally, DMCMC harnesses the parallel computing
					power of <em>Graphical Processing Units</em> (GPUs) to speed-up the sampling process. The experimental results show that DMCMC
					can find good solutions up to two order of magnitude faster than other incomplete DCOP algorithms.

		  		<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong>:
				Constraint programming has gained prominence as an effective and declarative paradigm for modeling and solving complex combinatorial problems. Techniques based on local search have proved practical to solve real-world problems, providing a good compromise between optimality and efficiency. In spite of the natural presence of concurrency, there has been relatively limited effort to use novel massively parallel architectures, such as those found in modern Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), to speedup local search techniques in constraint programming. This paper describes a novel framework which exploits parallelism from a popular local search method (the Large Neighborhood Search method), using GPUs.
