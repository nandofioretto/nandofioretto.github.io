									This OptMAS workshop invites works from different strands of the multi-agent systems community that pertain to the design of algorithms, models, and techniques to deal with multi-agent optimization problems. We will also place a particular emphasis on DCR approaches, which include the modeling, formulation and solution of DCR problems, including both Distributed Constraint Satisfaction and Optimization Problems.

							<h2>About</h2>

 							The number of novel applications of multi-agent systems has followed an exponential trend over the last few years, ranging from online auction design, through multi-sensor networks, to scheduling of tasks in multi-actor systems. Multi-agent systems designed for all these  applications generally involve some form of very hard optimization problems that are substantially different from problems traditionally dealt with in other areas (e.g. industrial processes or scheduling applications). More specifically, the technical issues that multi-agent algorithm designers have to deal with include:
							<ul>
								<li>Open systems: algorithms to compute solutions to mechanisms that deal with different stakeholders, who may be self-interested or may have different computation or communication capabilities from their peers.</li>
								<li>Distributed systems: algorithms that are across different system components, such as those that deal with agents that are tied to physical devices. This involves considerations of computation and communication constraints, and the possibility of failures of the components and/or communication links.</li>
								<li>Privacy concerns: solving optimization problems while minimizing the exchange of private information.</li>
								<li>Solution quality bounds: problems requiring anytime and/or approximate algorithms with quality bounds.</li>
								<li>Robust optimization: techniques to deal with optimizations that are repeated with only slight changes in the input data and/or with unreliable input data, which require solutions that are robust to these differences.</li>
								<li>Highly parallel architectures: e.g., multi-core, GPGPU, which deal with large-scale problems with massive data and task parallelism.</li>
							</ul>

							In particular, workshop organizers are seeking papers on the following (but not limited to) topics:
							<ul>
								<li>Distributed constraint optimization/satisfaction</li>
								<li>Winner determination algorithms in auctions</li>
								<li>Coalition formation algorithms</li>
								<li>Algorithms to compute Nash and other equilibria in games</li>
								<li>Optimization under uncertainty</li>
								<li>Optimization with incomplete or dynamic input data</li>
								<li>Algorithms for real-time applications</li>
								<li>GPU for general purpose computations (GPGPU)</li>
								<li>Multi-core and many-core computing</li>
								<li>Cloud, distributed and grid computing</li>
							</ul>
<!-- 
							OptMAS places particular emphasis on distributed constraint reasoning (DCR) approaches, which include the modeling, formulation and solution of DCR problems, including both Distributed Constraint Satisfaction and Optimization Problems. DCR problems arise when pieces of information about variables, constraints or both are relevant to independent but communicating agents. They provide a promising framework to deal with the increasingly diverse range of distributed real world problems emerging from the evolution of computation and communication technologies. Example DCR-specific technical issues include:
							<ul>
								<li>Unified frameworks for distributed constraint reasoning</li>
								<li>Complete and incomplete algorithms for solving distributed constraint reasoning problems</li>
								<li>Privacy issues in distributed constraint reasoning</li>
								<li>Problem solving in systems with self-interested agents</li>
								<li>Negotiation among self-interested agents</li>
								<li>Distributed constraint propagation and consistency</li>
								<li>Generation and formulation/modeling of distributed constraint reasoning</li>
								<li>Applications of distributed constraint reasoning</li>
							</ul> -->

<!-- 								Dr. Amnon Meisels is a professor in the department of Computer Science at Ben-Gurion University. His main field of research is Distributed Constraints Reasoning and in the last 7 years a major effort has been to investigate models for self-interested agents in Distributed Constrained Search. His book “Distributed Search by Constrained Agents”, was published by Springer Verlag in January 2008. 
								Since 2002 Prof. Meisels has lead a group of graduate students at BGU that have established algorithmic standards for distributed search on distributed constraints satisfaction problems (DCSPs) and distributed constraints optimization problems (DCOPs). These include the best performing DCR algorithms for DCSPs - AFC & ConcDB - and for DCOPs - AFB & ConcFB.  -->
<!-- 								Prof. Meisels has served on the program committees of all major AI conferences that deal with constraints-based reasoning over the last 7 years. Specifically for Constraints Processing (CP conferences); IJCAI; ECAI; and the series of PATAT conferences on Automatic Timetabling, where he has been a member of the steering committee since 2000. In addition he has been part of the organizing committee of the series of workshops on distributed constraints reasoning (DCR series) every year since 2003.  -->
								
								<h4><strong>Incentive-based Search by Selfish Agents</strong></h4>
								<p>
									<strong>Abstract: </strong>
									Search for stable solutions in games is a hard problem that includes two families of constraints. The global stability constraint and multiple soft constraints that express preferences for socially preferred solutions. The talk will focus on distributed search by multi-agents, to find stable solutions (e.g., pure Nash equilibria - PNEs) of high efficiency. The multiple agents perform distributed search on an asymmetric distributed constraints optimization problem (ADCOP). 
									<br>

									Three families of multi-agents games will be very briefly presented. Boolean games will be presented together with complete search algorithms that incorporate two kinds of incentives - taxation and side-payments. Next, the family of Public Goods Games (PGGs) will be presented and serve to discuss approximate (local) distributed search for a PNE that uses incentives. Since PGGs are shown to be potential games, the convergence of best-response is guaranteed. The use of incentives will enable best-response to converge to a PNE of higher social welfare.  
									<br>

									Finally, for general games, a distributed local search algorithm that uses transfer of funds among selfish agents will be presented. The final outcome of the algorithm can be stabilized by transfer of funds among the agents, where the transfer function is contracted among the agents during search. The proposed algorithm - Iterative Nash Efficiency enhancement Algorithm (INEA) - guarantees improved efficiency for any initial outcome. It can be looked at as an extension to best response dynamics, that uses transfer functions to guarantee convergence and enforce stability in games. Unlike best-response, the proposed INEA converges to efficient and stable outcomes even in games that are not potential games.
