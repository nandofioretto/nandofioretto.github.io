		<h3>Course Description</h3>
		<p>
			This course will introduce the basic ideas and techniques 
			underlying the design of intelligent agents to enable them 
			to act and "think" like humans. The topics covered include 
			problem-solving via search, game playing, logical and 
			probabilistic reasoning, machine learning (decision trees, 
			linear models, neural networks, and reinforcement learning). 
			A key aspect of this course is the presence of several 
			<a href="prjects.html">hands-on projects</a> that will help 
			to concertize the fundamental methods studied. 
		</p>
		<p>
			By the end of this course, you will have 
			<ul>
				<li>Built autonomous agents that efficiently make decisions in fully informed, 
					partially observable, and adversarial settings.</li>
				<li>Your agents will draw inferences in uncertain environments 
				    and optimize actions for arbitrary reward structures.</li>
				<li>Your machine learning algorithms will classify handwritten 
					digits and photographs.</li> 
			</ul> 
			The techniques you learn in this course apply to a wide 
			variety of artificial intelligence problems and will serve 
			as the foundation for further study in any application area 
			you choose to pursue.
		</p>

		<h3>Classroom Instruction</h3>

		<h5>Attendance</h5>
		The course will be in-person. Attendance is mandatory unless 
		justified by sickness / quarantine isolation (if applicable). 
		<br>
		Students who enter quarantine (exposure to a COVID-positive person) 
		or isolation (confirmed COVID infection) may not be able to attend 
		in-person class sessions (depending on university-level policy). 
		<br>
		<strong>Pre-recorded lectures</strong> will be available to all, 
		thus, even if you cannot attend class I will ensure you will get 
		the best possible learning experience through these material. 

		
		<h5>Suggestions</h5>		
		<ul>
			<li><span style="color: #B03A2E;">Wear a mask</span>: 
				This is recommended. </li>

			<li><span style="color: #B03A2E;">No eating/drinking</span>:
			This is a strict rule.</li> 

			<li><span style="color: #B03A2E;">No questions at the end 
			of the class</span>: 
			To safeguard our mutual health, I will not accept 
			students stopping by to ask questions at the end of the 
			class. Please see below for the mechanisms we are adopting 
			to foster online discussion. 
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>Online Tools</h5>
		We will use different systems to enhance the class experience:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aSlM7JP-RNOHQuKUxZRIf5sVp6roTdHOXqsAUm1fRc8E1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=d4533ba7-cde4-4d57-a959-198a709208f0&tenantId=4278a402-1a9e-4eb9-8414-ffb55a5fcf1e">Teams</a>: Group activities performed during
			class, FAQ, and homework/project discussions will take place 
			on the class Teams channel.
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/264994">Gradscope</a>: 
				Homework, Projects, (and possibly Exams)
				will be submitted and graded using the Gradscope 
				course page.
			</li>
		</ul>


		<h3>Prereq</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>CIS 375, CIS 321 and (CIS 351 or CSE 382)</li>
			<li>Knowledge of Python. This will be critical to complete 
			the projects. 
			Students may not have strong experience with the language, 
			but we do expect you to learn the basics very rapidly. 
			<a href="projects/p0.html">Project 0</a> is designed to teach you the 
			basics of Python. <br>
			If you want to follow some extra good tutorial, try the
			<a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/sigunix/workshops/crashpython/crashpython.pdf">ACM Python Tutorial</a>
		</li>
		</ul>		
		If you are unsure about any of these, please speak to the instructor.
		
		<h3>Communication</h3>

		There will be several routes of communication for this course:
		<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aSlM7JP-RNOHQuKUxZRIf5sVp6roTdHOXqsAUm1fRc8E1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=d4533ba7-cde4-4d57-a959-198a709208f0&tenantId=4278a402-1a9e-4eb9-8414-ffb55a5fcf1e">Teams Channel</a>
		The main mode of electronic communication between students 
		instructors and TAs, as well as amongst students, is through 
		Teams. It is intended for general questions about the course, 
		clarifications about assignments, student questions to each 
		other, discussions about the material, and so on. We strongly encourage 
		students to participate in discussions, ask, and answer questions. 
		</li>
		<li>
		<a href="mailto:ffiorett@syr.edu">Email</a>:
		If you need to contact the course staff privately, you should email 
		the instructor or TAs.
		Emails sent to the instructor's or TAs' email addresses may not
		receive an answer. 
		</li>

		
		<h3>Textbook and Online Material</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Course textbook: <a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/index.html">
			Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach (3rd edition)</a> 
		by Russell and Norvig and published by Prentice Hall (ISBN: 0136042597).</li>
			<li>Online Material: <a href="https://d2l.ai">Dive into Deep Learning</a>  
				by Aston Zhang, Zachary C. Lipton, Mu Li, and Alexander J. Smola</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python">AIMACODE Python</a></li>
		</ul>


		<h3>Assignments</h3>

		This class includes 11 homework (highly recommended and for extra-credits), 6 programming projects, 
		2 mini-exams, and 1 final exam.

		Homework are handled electronically on the 
		<a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/264994">gradscope course page</a> 
		<br>
		<br>
		<h5>Late Policy</h5>
		<ul>
<!-- 		<li>Homework cannot be turned in late, you have to use your homework drops.</li> -->
		<li>Projects lose 20% of their total point value per day turned in late, and the maximum number 
		of late days is 3.</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		<h5>Collaboration</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Projects are to be submitted individually, but may be 
			discussed in groups. If discussed in a group, acknowledge 
			your collaborators.
		</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
<!-- 		<h5>Homework Drop Policy</h5>
		You will be allowed to drop your <strong>3 lowest-scoring homework</strong>. 
		These may be distributed throughout the semester. 
		When calculating final grades, this will happen automatically, 
		we’ll just use your highest scoring submissions.
		<br>
		Note that this policy is also meant to deal with cases like 
		internet issues while submitting, forgetting about the deadline, 
		emergency situations (including medical).
 -->
		<h3>Exams</h3>
		There will be 2 mini-exams and 1 final exam. Both mini-exams 
		and the final exam are open-book and open-notes.<br>
		<br>
		There will be no make-up exams unless there is a medical document
		that justifies the absence. 

		<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
		<p>
		Any instance of sharing or plagiarism, copying, cheating, or other 
		disallowed behavior will constitute a breach of ethics. Students 
		are responsible for reporting any violation of these rules by other 
		students, and failure to constitutes an ethical violation that carries 
		with it similar penalties.
		<br><br>
		SU students are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic
		integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a
		year during pre-term check-in on <a href="https://myslice.ps.syr.edu/">MySlice</a>. 
		For more information about the policy, see the <a href="https://class.syr.edu/">policy website</a>. 
		<br><br>
		All academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person quizzes 
		and exams also apply to online quizzes and exams. In this course, 
		all work submitted for quizzes and exams must be yours alone. 
		Discussing quiz or exam questions with anyone during the quiz or exam 
		period violates academic integrity expectations for this course.
		<br><br>
		Using websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material 
		(e.g. Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments 
		completed by others and present the work as your own violates academic 
		integrity expectations in this course.
		</p>

	For more information about letter grades, including in the event 
	of withdrawal, drop, or incomplete, see Grades and Grading Symbols 
	in Academic Rules (Academic Catalog, Academic Rules Section 8.4.1).
	<br>
	For academic support services such as tutoring, see the 
	<a href="https://class.syr.edu/">Center for Learning and Student Success</a>.

	<h5>Regrade Policy</h5>
	If you believe an error has been made in the grading of one of 
	your exams or assignments, you may resubmit it for a regrade. 
	Regrades for cases where we misapplied a rubric in an individual 
	case is much more likely to be successful than regrades that argue 
	about relative point values within the rubric, as the rubric is 
	applied to the entire class. <br>
	Because we will examine your entire submission in detail, your 
	grade can go up or down as a result of a regrade request.

	<h3>SU Stay Safe Pledge</h3>
	Syracuse University’s Stay Safe Pledge reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on the well-being of our community members. This pledge defines norms for behavior that will promote community health and wellbeing. Classroom expectations include the following: wearing a mask that covers the nose and mouth at all times, maintaining a distance of six feet from others, and staying away from class if you feel unwell. Students who do not follow these norms will not be allowed to continue in face-to-face classes; repeated violations will be treated as violations of the Code of Student Conduct and may result in disciplinary action. 


	<h3>Mental Health</h3>

	Mental health and overall well-being are significant predictors of 
	academic success.  As such it is essential that during your college 
	experience you develop the skills and resources effectively to 
	navigate stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns.  
	Please familiarize yourself with the range of resources the Barnes 
	Center provides (<a href="https://ese.syr.edu/bewell/">https://ese.syr.edu/bewell/</a>) 
	and seek out support for mental health concerns as needed. Counseling services are 
	available 24/7, 365 days, at 315-443-8000, and I encourage you to 
	explore the resources available through the Wellness Leadership Institute, 
	<a href="https://ese.syr.edu/bewell/wellness-leadership-institute/">https://ese.syr.edu/bewell/wellness-leadership-institute/</a>

	<h3>University-wide Policies</h3>
	
	Students should review the University’s policies regarding:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibility-diversity/">Diversity and Disability</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://policies.syr.edu/">Religious Observances Notification and Policy</a></li>	
		<li><a href="https://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/">Orange SUccess</a></li>

	</ul>
	
	<br>
	<h5>Disability-Related Accommodations</h5>
	<p>
	Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed 
	to a climate of mutual respect and full participation.  
	There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course 
	that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course.  
	I invite any student to contact me to discuss strategies and/or 
	accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your 
	success and to collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources (CDR) in this process.
	<br>
	If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register with CDR, 
	please visit Center for Disability Resources. Please call (315) 443-4498 or 
	email <a href="mailto:disabilityresources@syr.edu">disabilityresources@syr.edu</a> 
	for more detailed information.
	<br>
	The CDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic 
	accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. 
	Since academic accommodations may require early planning and generally are 
	not provided retroactively, please contact CDR as soon as possible to begin this process.
	</p>

	<br>
	<h5>Discrimination or Harassment</h5> 
	<p> 
		Federal and state law, and
	University policy prohibit discrimination and harassment based
	on sex or gender (including sexual harassment, sexual assault,
	domestic/dating violence, stalking, sexual exploitation, and
	retaliation). If a student has been harassed or assaulted,
	they can obtain confidential counseling support, 24-hours a
	day, 7 days a week, from the <a href="https://ese.syr.edu/bewell/sexual-and-relationship-violence/">
		Sexual and Relationship Violence Response Team</a> at the Counseling Center (315-443-8000, Barnes
	Center at The Arch, 150 Sims Drive, Syracuse, New York 13244).
	Incidents of sexual violence or harassment can be reported
	non-confidentially to the University’s Title IX Officer
	(Sheila Johnson Willis, 315-443-0211, <a href="mailto:titleix@syr.edu">titleix@syr.edu</a>, 005
	Steele Hall). Reports to law enforcement can be made to the
	University’s Department of Public Safety (315-443-2224, 005
	Sims Hall), the Syracuse Police Department (511 South State
	Street, Syracuse, New York, 911 in case of emergency or
	315-435-3016 to speak with the Abused Persons Unit), or the
	State Police (844-845-7269). I will seek to keep information
	you share with me private to the greatest extent possible, but
	as a professor I have mandatory reporting responsibilities to
	share information regarding sexual misconduct, harassment, and
	crimes I learn about with the University’s Title IX Officer to
	help make our campus a safer place for all.
