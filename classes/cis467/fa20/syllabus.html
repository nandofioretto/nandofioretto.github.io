		<h1> Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Syllabus</h1>
	<div id="content">
		<strong>Note</strong>: The syllabus is subject to change.

		<h3>Course Description</h3>
		<p>
			This course will introduce the basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent agents to enable them to act and "think" like humans. The topics covered include problem-solving via search, game playing, logical and probabilistic reasoning, machine learning (decision trees, linear models, neural networks, and reinforcement learning). A key aspect of this course is the presence of several hands-on projects that will help to concertize the fundamental methods studied. 
		<br>
		By the end of this course, you will have built autonomous agents that efficiently make decisions in fully informed, partially observable, and adversarial settings. Your agents will draw inferences in uncertain environments and optimize actions for arbitrary reward structures. Your machine learning algorithms will classify handwritten digits and photographs. The techniques you learn in this course apply to a wide variety of artificial intelligence problems and will serve as the foundation for further study in any application area you choose to pursue.
		</p>

		<p>The course will have a hybrid structure: Synchronous online and residential. What does this mean? 
			Lectures will be broadcast during class time. You can either attend the class physically or virtually 
			(see below for tools and restrictions). All materials will be made available for later consultation. 
		<br>
		</p>

		<h3>Online Tools, Restrictions, and Classroom Behavior</h3>

		<h5>Attendance</h5>
		To comply with the health safety University policy and
		enforce social distancing, students will be allowed to 
		participate in-class only <strong>every other lecture</strong>.
		A list and seat assignment will be released prior to the start of the first class. <br>
		Regardless of your in-class participation turn, you are encouraged 
		to follow the classes online. 

		<h5>Restrictions</h5>		
		<ul>
			<li><span style="color: #B03A2E;">Wear a mask</span>: 
				This is mandatory. No student, TA, or faculty, 
				will be allowed, at any time, to remove her/his mask.</li>

			<li><span style="color: #B03A2E;">Respect social distancing rules</span>: 
				You will need to be at 
				least 6ft apart from other individuals. This rule must be 
				enforced during class and while transiting in the classroom 
				(e.g., to join/leave the class).
			</li>

			<li><span style="color: #B03A2E;">Bring your own laptop or smartphone and headphones</span>.
				We will alternate lecture content with class activities ran 
				asynchronously with other students attending online.

			<li><span style="color: #B03A2E;">No eating/drinking</span>:
			This is a strict rule.</li> 

<!-- 			<li><span style="color: #B03A2E;">Minimize talking</span>: 
				To minimize the diffusion of respiratory droplets (even if wearing masks) 
				we will maximize the use of students' Q/A via chat. 
			</li>
 -->		</ul>

		<h5>Online Tools</h5>
		We will use different systems to enhance the class experience,
		and to best respond to the issues rose by the current pandemic.

	For more information about letter grades, including in the event 
	of withdrawal, drop, or incomplete, see Grades and Grading Symbols 
	in Academic Rules (Academic Catalog, Academic Rules Section 8.4.1).
	<br>
	For academic support services such as tutoring, see the 
	<a href="https://class.syr.edu/">Center for Learning and Student Success</a>.

	<h5>Regrade Policy</h5>
	If you believe an error has been made in the grading of one of 
	your exams or assignments, you may resubmit it for a regrade. 
	Regrades for cases where we misapplied a rubric in an individual 
	case is much more likely to be successful than regrades that argue 
	about relative point values within the rubric, as the rubric is 
	applied to the entire class. <br>
	Because we will examine your entire submission in detail, your 
	grade can go up or down as a result of a regrade request.

	<h3>SU Stay Safe Pledge</h3>
	Syracuse Universityâ€™s Stay Safe Pledge reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on the well-being of our community members. This pledge defines norms for behavior that will promote community health and wellbeing. Classroom expectations include the following: wearing a mask that covers the nose and mouth at all times, maintaining a distance of six feet from others, and staying away from class if you feel unwell. Students who do not follow these norms will not be allowed to continue in face-to-face classes; repeated violations will be treated as violations of the Code of Student Conduct and may result in disciplinary action.â€©

	<h3>University-wide Policies</h3>
	
	Students should review the Universityâ€™s policies regarding:

	for coordinating disability-related academic adjustments and will issue students with
	documented Disabilities Accommodation Authorization Letters, as appropriate. Since
	academic adjustments may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively,
	please contact ODS as soon as possible.
	
	<h5>Diversity and Disability</h5>
	Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual
	respect and full participation. My goal is to create learning environments that are useable,
	equitable, inclusive, and welcoming. If there are aspects of the instruction or design of this
	course that result in barriers to your inclusion or accurate assessment or achievement, I invite
	you to meet with me to discuss additional strategies beyond academic adjustments that may be
	helpful to your success.
	
	<h5>Academic Integrity</h5>
	Any instance of sharing or plagiarism, copying, cheating, or other 
	disallowed behavior will constitute a breach of ethics. Students 
	are responsible for reporting any violation of these rules by other 
	students, and failure to constitutes an ethical violation that carries 
	with it similar penalties.

	SU students are required to read an online summary of the Universityâ€™s academic
	integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a
	year during pre-term check-in on <a href="https://myslice.ps.syr.edu/">MySlice</a>.
