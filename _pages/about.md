I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at [UVA](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science). I lead the [Trustworthy and Responsible Learning and Optimization](_pages/group.md) group where we make advances in artificial intelligence with focus on two key themes:\\
  **AI for Science and Engineering**: We develop the foundations to blend deep learning and constrained optimization for complex scientific and engineering problems.\\
  <!-- and  create ways to integrate knowledge, constraints, and physical principles into learning models. -->
  **Trustworthy & Responsible AI**: We analyze the equity of AI systems in support of decision-making and learning tasks, focusing especially on privacy and fairness.

<!-- I approach these directions by applying the tools and perspectives of
_optimization theory_, _differential privacy_, and _statistics_ to problems in
decision-making and machine learning. For more details, please see my [publications](_pages/about.md). -->

My group is generously supported by the _National Science Foundation_, _Google_, _Amazon_,
and the University of Virginia.\\
<!-- I am a recipient of the _2022 AWS Amazon Research Award_, the _2022 NSF CAREER award_,
the 2022 _Google Research Scholar Award_, the _2022 Caspar Bowden PET award_, the
_2021 ISSNAF Mario Gerla Young Investigator Award_, the _2021 ACP Early Career Researcher Award_,
the _2018 AI*AI Best AI dissertation award_, and _several best paper awards_. -->
Before joining the University of Virginia, I was an assistant professor at
Syracuse University. Prior to that I was a postdoctoral research associate at the
Georgia Institute of Technology and a research fellow at the University of Michigan.
For more details, please see my [CV](cv/).
